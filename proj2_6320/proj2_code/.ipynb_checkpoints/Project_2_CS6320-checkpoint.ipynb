    "   1. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). It doesn’t matter whether you use Python 2 or 3 because we will create our own environment that uses 3 anyways.\n",
    "   2. Create a conda environment using the appropriate command. On Windows, open the installed “Conda prompt” to run the command. On MacOS and Linux, you can just use a terminal window to run the command, Modify the command based on your OS (linux, mac, or win): `conda env create -f proj2_env.yml`.\n",

    "   3. This should create an environment named ‘proj2’. Activate it using the Windows command, activate proj2 or the MacOS / Linux command, source activate proj2\n",
    "   4. Run the notebook using `jupyter notebook` under *proj2_6320* directory.\n",
